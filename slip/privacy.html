        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    Slip POS does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from
    users.
</p>

<p>
    All data entered into the app — including sales records, settings,
    and menu items — is stored locally on the user's device. Slip POS
    operates entirely offline and does not use any network services,
    analytics tools, or cloud storage.
</p>

<p>
    We do not track user behavior, collect location data, or access
    personal information in any form. If any network-based features
    (such as cloud backup or online syncing) are introduced in the
    future, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly.
</p>

    If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at:
